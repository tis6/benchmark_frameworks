"49425012","1","49575230","","2018-03-22 09:32:42","","4","3510","<p>So I feel like I have come to the end of the rope here, but hoping someone knows more than I do here. I have some <code>Typescript</code> files, though that is mostly irrelevant as I am having this problem with all content files.</p>

<p>I am able to generate a <code>nuget</code>, or more precisely <code>dotnet pack</code>, nuget package that includes my content files in the package by using this in the <code>.csproj</code> of my <code>parent</code> project:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;Content Include=""Scripts\Utility.ts""&gt;
    &lt;Pack&gt;true&lt;/Pack&gt;
    &lt;PackagePath&gt;contentFiles\Scripts\;content\Scripts&lt;/PackagePath&gt;
  &lt;/Content&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I can browse the generated <code>.nupkg</code> and see that indeed the file was added to the package in both the <code>content\Scripts</code> and <code>contentFiles\Scripts</code> locations</p>

<p>The problem is that whenver I consume this package in my 'child' progect, that <code>Typescript</code> never gets copied into any folder of the <code>child</code> project, though I can see it extracted in the <code>.nuget\packages\parent\...</code> folders.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was something with my initial settings in the <code>parent</code> project, and it may be, but after trying what seems like everything in the book, that fails to copy the content files to the <code>child</code> project. I then tried going the dark path of trying to use <code>Init.ps1</code> in the <code>tools</code> folder of my package, and though it was impossible to debug, it also seemed to run sporatically (I completely unistalled and reinstalled the package and it still failed to run most of the time.) This could be the way but I don't know why I can't get it to output to the <code>Package Manager Console</code>... maybe there's still hope with <code>Init.ps1</code> but I can't seem to figure it out. Finally I see some potential with a <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nuget <code>.targets</code> file</a> but I can's seem to grasp how to use it for my purpose either! I would love some feedback as to how to get this done.</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to programming and I'm trying to create a website to house the web apps I build. I currently have a model, view, and controller to project the contents of my Apps table. These apps are hosted elsewhere, so the tiles that appear in the screenshot below simply link out to other locations. I'd like to include a way to display recently used apps in a drawer, (the code housed in the _Layout). </p>

<p><em>_Layout Drawer:</em></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qNeh.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qNeh.png"" alt=""_Layout Drawer""></a></p>

<p>I'd like to start by displaying ANY model data in the _Layout drawer. If I simply throw my Apps View code into the _Layout, like so:</p>

<pre><code>@_Layout, located beneath navbar code and above RenderBody()@
@model IEnumerable&lt;Apps&gt;
&lt;div id=""footerSlideContainer""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""footerSlideButton""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div id=""footerSlideText""&gt;

            &lt;div class=""parenttile""&gt;

                {
                    &lt;a href=""http://@Apps.AppLink"" target=""_blank""&gt;
                        &lt;div class=""tile""&gt;

                            &lt;div class=""tilemid""&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                    &lt;img class=""tileimage"" src=""@Apps.AppImage"" alt=""@Apps.AppName"" /&gt;

                                &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;div class=""tilebot""&gt;
                                @Apps.AppName

            &lt;p&gt;This section will store all of your most recently used apps. It stays on the screen until you click the drawer icon.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

<p>...I get the following error in Debug on the @foreach line: NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. .net core. I researched that error here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4660142/what-is-a-nullreferenceexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it"">What is a NullException error and how do I fix it?</a></p>

<ol>
<li>I understand the action method comes before the model displays. If I
were to use the above code, I would presume that I need to inject
the model into the action method - but, does the _layout have a
controller?</li>
<li>I researched here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/29369637/10295594"">ASP MVC Razor Pass model to view </a>. This
looks like the closest solution, but would appreciate someone
walking me through it.</li>
<li>Finally, I noticed that I could use a ViewComponent <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components?view=aspnetcore-2.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ViewComponent
in ASP.NET Core</a>. I could use some help implementing this solution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which of these solutions would work/work best?</p>

<p>Then there's the issue of creating the favorites. I think that's a bit more straightforward, as this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34121235/display-recently-viewed-items"">Display recently viewed items</a> contains all the info I think I need.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help - I'm including my model and controller code below:</p>

<p>Model: </p>

{

    public int AppID { get; set; }
    public string AppName { get; set; }

<p>I am trying to pass the version.  Here is the nuspec:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;package xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd""&gt;
    &lt;metadata&gt;

&lt;/package&gt;

<p>And here is my command:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dotnet.exe pack  /p:NuspecFile=./App.Nuspec
  /p:PackageVersion=9.7.28170</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get the error:
<em>Value cannot be null or an empty string.</em> </p>

<p>Interestingly, if I change the variable to be the description:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;version&gt;1.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;description&gt;$PackageVersion$&lt;/description&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I get the error: <em>Description is required.</em></p>

<p>When the tag is description the tag name is in the error message.  However, when the tag is version there is no tag name in the error message - only the term value.  Both are required fields.</p>

<p>I am doing this with the command line on my local machine, but the TFS build gives the same error.  Here is the TFS tooltip for the Additional build properties for that step.
<em>Specifies a list of token = value pairs, separated by semicolons, where each occurrence of $token$ in the .nuspec file will be replaced with the given value. Values can be strings in quotation marks.</em></p>

<p>It sounds like I am following those rules.  And here is what TFS generates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe"" pack
  D:\Agent_work\5\s\MyProject\MyProject.csproj --output
  D:\Agent_work\5\a /p:NuspecFile=App.nuspec

<p>So far, I can make the project build, but getting a zip file out of it seems problematic - passing the inputs zipAfterPublish etc appears impossible to pass, although, there is some scattered documentation suggesting these can be passed with -p:""optiona=x;optionb=y"" or /p:""optiona=x;optionb=y"". I can find no definitive documentation on this.</p>

<p>This is what I have - the build part works, the $PWD/out directory is populated with many files but nothing is zipped:</p>

<pre><code>dotnet publish --configuration Release --output $PWD/out /p:""zipAfterPublish=true;publishWebProjects=true""
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing this is around how to pass the inputs ( <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/build/dotnet-core-cli?view=azure-devops"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/build/dotnet-core-cli?view=azure-devops</a> ) correctly to the command.</p>

<p>This project is a simple hello world console application, written in c# .net core 3.1</p>

<p>When I build or publish this project locally I get the following output:</p>

<ul>
<li>146 appsettings.deploy.json</li>
<li>186 appsettings.json</li>
<li>416 TestYaml.deps.json</li>
<li>4.608 TestYaml.dll</li>
<li>171.520 TestYaml.exe</li>
<li>656 TestYaml.pdb</li>
<li>154 TestYaml.runtimeconfig.json</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the published Artifacts through the build pipeline gives me these files:</p>

<ul>
<li>140 appsettings.deploy.json</li>
<li>179 appsettings.json</li>
<li>394 TestYaml.deps.json</li>
<li>4.608 TestYaml.dll</li>
<li>86.424 TestYaml</li>
<li>632 TestYaml.pdb</li>
<li>146 TestYaml.runtimeconfig.json</li>
</ul>

<p>So here, the file sizes are smaller, and more importantly the TestYaml.exe is missing and is replaced by a TestYaml file.</p>

<p>This should be rather straightforward, but I don't see what's missing.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>
